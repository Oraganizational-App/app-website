# Review: To-do List
Create a functional to-do list using HTML/CSS/JS

## HTML
- Build a sample of a few items in a to-do list
- Add a form to add new items

## CSS
- Develop a responsive style for the list
- Create styles for hovering, clicking and completing tasks

## Javascript
- Store some sample tasks in an array using JSON
- Add new items to the list using the form
- Clicking an item indicates it as complete or incomplete

## Next Steps:

What other features could we use/create? Here are a few ideas:

- Drag and drop items to prioritize?
- Give them a status colour or progress indicator
- Store the list items (local storage? database? etc)
