                <p>Allowing you to focus on all the things that you need to-do today!</p>

                <p>We know how stressful it can be looking at a monthly or weekly overview.</p>

                <p>Seeing all the tasks you need to complete across multiple days can really freak some people out.</p>

                <p>We wanted to create an app that mainly focsued on each individual day.</p>

                <p>Having all your taks for the day in one spot and also being able to categorize them as well. </p>

          <h5>

            First tasks is the first app designed by To-do Today!

              <p>Our <strong>main goal</strong> with this app is that we wanted to <strong>'Take one day at a time'.</strong></p>

              <p>We designed this app for those who love working hard but have just too many tasks to complete.</p>

              <p>We wanted our users to be able to focus on just one of their busy days at a time.</p>

              <p>Making sure they prioritize all their <strong>first tasks</strong> for the day.</p>

              <p>By creating this app we allow users to focus on all their 'firsts' for the day.</p>

              <p>Completing their first tasks in order to move on to the next (their next day).</p>
